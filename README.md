## GDAL with the Python API ##
#### Core functions to get starter working with spatial data ####

This repository was set up in particular to explore the functionalities of the GDAL api, and to built a better familiarity with the Python API. As of yet, the repository contains a single script which covers some of the basic functions of GDAL, namely:

1. Reading and writing shapefiles and rasters
2. Spatial transformations and projections
3. Extracting features from larger polygons
4. Clipping raster files by polygon geometry
5. Masking raster data by values
6. Converting raster data to polygons
7. Creating new polygons based on lists of coordinates.
